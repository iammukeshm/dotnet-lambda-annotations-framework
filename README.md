# .NET Lambda Annotations Framework 
## for Simplified AWS Lambda Development

Cleaner way to write .NET AWS Lambdas - using the Annotations Framework!

In this article, we will explore the .NET Lambda Annotations Framework released recently by the AWS Team to improve development experiences while working with AWS Lambdas. This Framework makes the entire Lambda Function creation task feel more natural to C# / .NET Developers. Additionally, it also syncs with your code changes and generates CloudFormation templates for the Lambda resources.

We will cover aspects like Dependency Injection, CloudFormation Templates, DynamoDB, and related permission, and SAM Deployment as well.
